question can heritage the driving force our economy. would seem say jeff morgan the global heritage fund that published the report. morgan point out that estimated one-third all international travel cultural heritage-related. tourism now increasingly viewed core economic growth strategy for many country and should embraced core component international development. countries investment the protection their heritage site highly correlated with economic growth and improved standard living. however may not simple that more for country like india where conservation remains huge challenge especially monument abound every nook and corner. add that lack conservation ethos and bureaucratic apathy and the problem get compounded. ours country where 'culture and 'heritage are word that are often over-used but when come implementation little get done lament jain founder the delhi-based sanskriti foundation.jain point out that problem often arise because lack consistency. even heritage site been successful not used model for similar site elsewhere. instead decision are taken arbitrarily without involving expert. the process lot money wasted. for instance there are many structure delhi for which grand plan were made but still people are openly defecating there. even popular heritage site which see lot tourist traffic the delicate balance between footfall and conservation been difficult achieve. catch-22 situation admits official with the archaeological survey india. places like the taj mahal the historic civic centre shimla which receive huge tourist inflow have constantly safeguarded against degradation. increased tourist flow put pressure many fragile site. then there the question political will. jain say that culture often considered soft subject and that show the bundling the portfolio with other ministry like youth sport affair. the government scheme are often well-intentioned but there rarely any follow-through. for instance under the public-private partnership the adopt-a-monument project good idea for corporates their bit for conservation but fell through because red tape. considering scenario like this correlating heritage and tourism with rapid economic growth really practical proposition india. there are many who believe that hinging the nation future economy tourism itself fragile notion for development. heritage consultant amita

community. good example the taj mahal india most iconic site which situated agra one the most dismal destination the world. because the closure industry ensure the taj mahal protected the city economy decline and people have paid very high price she says.inclusive development therefore the key. morgan agrees that empowering local community focusing expert aid and funding the most endangered site can help build strong infrastructure and ensure long-term stewardship heritage site thereby boosting the economy. education important role play sensitizing people. baig say that the valorization our heritage must part core curriculum. things can much easier once there educated populace who respect their heritage legacy their forefather. another idea learn from success story. jain point the success heritage palace rajasthan most whom have reinvented themselves hotel. these place are microcosm what heritage tourism india stand for complete value-added experience. essence cultural heritage should remain infused with life and energy else cease relevant. baig concurs that this especially true india where still have colonial mindset how manage our site. the western notion heritage

minister ruling from behind around said they 'somewhat agreed. comparison only 'completely disagreed with the notion and 'somewhat disagreed that mulayam ruling proxy.the public opinion based what they witnessed the past six month. akhilesh took charge the state march amid high expectation and hope. visible the huge turnout people the janta darshan programme one the several positive initiative taken him. but despite being accessible enthusiastic and with new idea the impression gaining ground that not control.akhilesh may have successfully removed the anti-english and anti-computer tag from but being pulled apart several power centre his uncle the government and yet come out his father shadow. fact started the day took oath. about minister around had criminal record including few with serious charge. all were selected mulayam whose stamp also visible the administrative reshuffle and posting officers.significantly when the government completed 100 day office june mulayam gave 100 mark his son and said the performance the government should judged after six month. but little over month later august mulayam rapped party leader the state executive meeting. said the performance the government far from satisfactory. akhilesh responded saying that will try live the expectation his father. however source said mulayam forced intervene because thing were not control senior minister were not listening akhilesh.in fact opposition party had started calling akhilesh 'bechara because the pull and pressure shivpal yadav and azam khan. trouble started even before akhilesh sworn. when akhilesh name proposed for the post chief minister newly elected mlas meeting party general secretary and mulayam cousin ram gopal yadav azam made his reservation public asking mulayam would not like rethink and take charge chief minister himself.since then azam and akhilesh have strained relationship although azam given important portfolio like urban development and minority affair. early mulayam did try clip azam wing promoting shahi imam delhi jama masjid maulana ahmed bukhari but not successful because the latter demanded more than what the party offering.azam did not speak against the party leadership then but caused major embarrassment april nominating khwaja haleem who expelled from akhilesh for anti-party activity member the state haj committee. mulayam had intervene and revoke kahlim expulsion april. mulayam forced intervene again july when azam wrote letter akhilesh offering resign from the cabinet and other political post after unceremoniously removed from the post minister in-charge meerut district.the charge restored within hour. another flashpoint came august when azam ordered the suspension lucknow municipal commissioner singh charge laxity but akhilesh did

akhilesh. but failed pacify shivpal who recent interview weekly said mulayam should have become chief minister.besides azam and shivpal ram gopal yadav emerged another power centre the party and the government. party source say ram gopal more close mulayam than others. helped mulayam akhilesh anointment and today the most powerful leader after mulayam.it could gauged from the fact that ram gopal recently expelled national president party youth wing sanjay lathar without even consulting akhilesh. lathar accompanying akhilesh who visit agra when the expulsion order served taking everyone surprise. further party source said netaji mulayam failing health also led struggle succession within the yadav family. several occasion said source mulayam had intervene and snub warring faction they said.sources also said shivpal and azam were behind akhilesh decision restrict use electricity shop and mall after and allow mlas use lakh from the development fund meant for their constituency buy car. however both the decision were taken back within hour after widespread criticism. akhilesh blamed for but the truth that acted only the suggestion his uncle said party leader.further source said

akhilesh asked all the cabinet colleague but only handful minister declared their assets.even student leader affiliated are not taking akhilesh seriously which explains why despite his warning they continue indulge rowdyism and violence state university. fact all this taken toll overall governance and the main cause for deterioration law and order the state. what damaged the party further are

but now turned soft towards concrete action been taken against the corrupt those responsible for the nrhm scam sugar mill sale scam the dalit memorial scam among others. but all may not lost yet. some political analyst pointed out that when given free hand akhilesh handled some situation well.for instance mended tie with the centre which helped get development package 57,000 crore. been able resolve the problem noida extension extent. though farmer some village are still agitating construction started residential area giving relief lakh home buyer. without being vindictive replaced the

dialogue the hope that pakistan would some stage abjure such act own interest. the dialogue collapsed however with the enormity the 2008 terrorist attack mumbai orchestrated the inter-services intelligence-jihadi group nexus. again after gap india persuaded itself that the no-dialogue option not sustainable and that the compulsion geography which pakistan disregard dictated that india begin talking pakistan again. four year have elapsed since the mumbai attack and two round dialogue have been held but without any tangible move pakistan try those guilty the mumbai attack. pakistan used the excuse complex legal procedure and independent judiciary explain the inordinate delay doing. meanwhile drive home india the futility demand allows hafiz saeed the purported mastermind the mumbai massacre engage freely his anti-india jihadi tirade. that unwilling put the defensive mumbai indicated insistence drawing parallel between meticulously planned terrorist action pakistani national indian soil with official pakistani complicity and isolated action local indian terrorist indian soil without any official connivance. worse pakistans foreign minister insult reality and decency pretending that terrorism longer issue between india and pakistan and advising realistic and not emotional about the mumbai trial. now the prime minister india say that will pakistan only pakistan demonstrates sincerity trying those responsible for mumbai and the foreign minister pakistan appalled that raise the terrorism mantra the past this old time stuff she call where the meeting ground between the way which and the pakistani leadership see the issue. our concession pakistan terrorism that the bilateral dialogue can continue have unfortunately led these scornful remark foreign minister. the prime minister were still pakistan would have diplomatically humiliated india finally the terrorism issue. put the matter the visit perspective our prime minister been meeting pakistans president and prime minister quite regularly india third country during international meeting whether ekaterinaberg sharm el-sheikh thimphu new york and most recently tehran. contact the highest political level being maintained. our expectation been that this willingness engage with pakistan would encourage bring the pernicious and dangerous issue terrorism political closure bilaterally terrorism the potential wreck the dialogue process mumbai-like attack repeated. happens pakistan succeeded blunting indias case terrorism even the united states america ironically increasingly exposed pakistans duplicity the issue. the prime minister were pakistan under these circumstance would have allowed the latter deny the only deliverable seek from. apart from bilateral dimension the terrorism issue there the international dimension. with religious extremism spreading the arab world and organization with violent political past acceding power hitherto moderate islamic state not mention the current street frenzy against the unleashed film india remain vigilant about the impact such development the popular spirit the region linked transnationally through religion and ideology with happening beyond. sign the maturing democracy pakistan and polity outgrowing india obsession pakistani commentator had noted that india had not figured electoral issue the last general election there. why should the prime minister visit this juncture play electorally favour the civilian government especially president asif ali zardaris any significant way. india fact never been position influence internal development pakistan suit interest. should discard any illusion this regard. while zardari doubt relatively congenial view india they not get reflected sufficiently policymaking. pakistans president highly embattled politically hardly position deliver substantive issue. any case the civilian government can not escape responsibility for the lack progress various issue that bedevil our relation apart from trade where different dynamic are play. let also not forget that not the military that created pakistan but civilian politician. civilian politician were fully complicit pakistans afghanistan adventure the unleashing terrorism kashmir the country clandestine nuclear and missile exchange with north korea and the anti-indian thrust the china relationship. should not entrap ourselves into the civilian good guy versus the military bad guy equation. elections are due pakistan latest february 2013. before that caretaker government will take over. for practical reason the timing prime ministerial visit this juncture would therefore ill-advised. for those who advocate that visit nankana sahib november and his village gah should remember that guru nanaks jayanti will celebrated next year too and gah will not effaced from the map the year come. let wait for pakistan deliver terrorism first.',\n",
